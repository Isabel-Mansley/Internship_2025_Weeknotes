# Week 7 - 11th August 2025
This week I decided to focus on looking at how the Cairngorms has changed over time. To do this I  I ran the training on the 2024 embeddings to ensure that if all training points were corresponding to the correct habitat and then classified for 2017. Then created a map with only the pixels that differed as shown below:

Some areas on the map were completely blank - for example lakes were the same in both.

However, there were many more pixel than I was expecting so I tried some different combinations of smoothing before and after generating the map to try and highlight the areas of change and not just where the model was unsure.

There were some promising areas on this map, for example, one of the densest areas of change was with clearfell (one example on the left of the image above), which in this case had been cleared sometime before 2017 and then started to regrow by 2024 resulting in a large amount of change.

A lot of the differing pixels were around the edges of habitats, often circling a lake, or area of forest etc. This is likely because one of the weaknesses of the model is that it must decide on one class for an area even if that area may contain multiple habitats resulting in the exact edge, or class at an edge of a feature being unreliable. This is shown below with both layers being smoothed for clarity and the differing pixels in light blue:

Unfortunately without significant change this map had too much interference to yield much useful data at present as it was difficult to see at a glace areas of interest.

Instead I decided to generate a confusion matrix to compare where the map had changed the most, hoping that then I could adjust layers on QGIS and manually find key areas of interest in the scatter of points.

This required normalizing the results so that you could see the percentage change in each class (otherwise heath being so common meant the confusion matrix didnâ€™t show anything major).

Going back to creating a map of changed areas I decided to try and reduce the interference by comparing multiple years and only recording a change if it was different from all previous years, in this case if 2024 was different to 2017, 2018, and 2019. Whilst this loses the ability to look at changes that occurred year by year, it does improve the usefulness of the map significantly. 
To create the map below I applied this method, smoothing all the year maps before comparing them:

Whilst there is still a lot of coverage, it is now possible to see blocks of clear fell where forest has been cut down, and heath/pine where it has started to has regrow - clear signs of human projects in the area. Note the map shows the colour of the 2024 map, so what the area became, not what it originally was.

I have also started looking into block based training to try and remove some of the individual pixel problems as a temporary solution. Hopefully next week, I will be able to create a UNET method to use instead of random forest to take into account spacial awareness as opposed to a pixel by pixel based analysis.
