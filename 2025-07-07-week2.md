This week was spent looking at Detectree2, which I was able to get up and running on my laptop on some sample imagery I was given. 
Detectree2 locates and delineates trees from aerial images and is software that I might use later on in the internship for trying to classify individual tree species once I am done with habitat mapping.

In addition to this I spent some time looking at open street view and satellite imagery of the Cairngorms to try and develop a better knowledge of the area, the habitats, and general features.

Later on in the week I spent some time learning how to use the TESSERA app before the workshop - and finding which commands needed to be changed to get it up and running on a windows machine.

In addition to this I got access to some field data which could be used to train the model; however, the labelling of habitat type was inconsistent and in the incorrect format for the program, so I wrote some code to correct this before the workshop.
