# Week 4 — 21 July 2025
This week I received the new embedding for the Cairngorms, which fixed some tiling issues that the previous one’s had. This alongside the new classes created should mean that the new maps will look very different but hopefully a lot more accurate.

The start of the week involved manually creating labels for the Cairngorms to fit with these new classes, and then combining all the files together into one. I was able to run the TESSERA classifier on my own laptop after a bit of work. It took 22 minutes to run which is a manageable amount, but means that I need to get access to a server if I want to classify New Zealand anytime in the future as it is a lot lot larger than the Cairngorms.

The next task for the week was manually verifying the random points that I had generated for New Zealand last week as it was important to ensure that the training data was of a high quality. 
To work out if manual verification was necessary in the future I recorded whether each point was approved or not as the class it claimed to be. 

The overall accuracy was: 86%, 700: 110; however, some class types were far more accurate than others. 
For example Built Up Area (Settlement) was 96% accurate and Lakes or Ponds was 97% accurate - with one of the incorrect points being due to a flood occurring which I couldn’t have complete certainty that it would be included in TESSERA’s 2024 data so decided to omit. 
Meaning that the accuracy of water bodies may actually be higher.

The main problem was not that the classes were incorrect, but rather that some points were placed just outside of a region of that class. 
For example, lying on a road or treeline next to a grassland plot, or on the scree at the side of a river or lake instead of on the water. 
It is possible that I could adjust how QGIS generates random points to avoid placing a point within a few meters of the edge of a polygon to drastically improve the accuracy and potentially make manual verification unnecessary in some categories.

Whilst waiting for server access to run the TESSERA classifier on the updated New Zealand points, I starting havig a look at some field data I was given on the Albertine rift (an area in West Africa). 
Trying to condense 16 years worth of field data, from different teams and regions into a manageable number of categories for the Albertine Rift.
About half of the labels were in French, so I had to dust off my sixth form French skills and translate them into the equivalent English classes.
