# Week 1 — 30 June 2025
Bit of a slow start to the internship due to focusing on onboarding. My first day was spent completing admin tasks to get access to the necessary buildings, websites, and communication platforms. 

One problem I ran into was: due to not being a Cambridge University student, I was starting from scratch and access cards and emails would take a few days to get approved. 
Fortunately, I did remember that I had an old university email from some college catering work I did. After some trial and error, trying to set a few things up, I discovered that this email did allow me to access everything I needed to (thus far at least) and helped to streamline the process of access forms considerably.

On day 2 I spent the day doing some preliminary research into TESSERA and Detectree2, reading through the research papers thoroughly and looking into any areas within these papers that I thought I might need to know more about in the future. 
For example, I looked into general information on the Cairngorms and the sentinel satellites to broaden my knowledge.

For the next 2 days I was volunteering at a Model UN conference so didn’t do any work for the internship; however, I did pop into the office on Wednesday evening to meet with David Coomes as he had just got back in and I was seeking some support and guidance. 
After that, I went to The Mill to chat with the other interns which was a lovely opportunity to hear about all the other interesting projects going on this summer.

On Friday I was back in the office, I looked into the Scottish Landcover by space intelligence and downloaded QGIS. 
Furthermore, I followed some tutorials of the software so that I would understand the basics when it comes to using it. 
I also read the documentation for R, as it looks likely that I will need to understand the language at some point. 
It was all fairly intuitive, decently similar to python, so does not concern me much.

Next, I am hoping to start actually doing work towards the workshop on the 14th July now that my supervisor and I am both in the office as I am aware that the deadline is fast approaching.
